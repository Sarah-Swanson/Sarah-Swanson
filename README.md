# About me


**Sarah-Swanson/Sarah-Swanson** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: my Associate's Degree in Web Design & Development. I plan to graduate this spring (2025)! 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: my rabbits! 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Canvas Inbox
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: my husband and I choose a different movie "theme" each month (some past examples include: horror movies, Nicolas Cage, Harry Potter movies, etc.)
